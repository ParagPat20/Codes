The design also incorporates **speed differential control** for movement direction during rolling mode.  

### **Key Novel Design Features**  
1. **Transformation Mechanism:**  
   - The robot transitions between **rolling mode** (legs retracted within a circular frame) and **walking mode** (legs extended for articulated locomotion).  
   - Uses a **servo-actuated unfolding system** to switch modes dynamically.  

2. **Aesthetics and Structural Form:**  
   - The **symmetrical leg arrangement** ensures both **walking stability** and **rolling efficiency**.  
   - **Outer disk structure** facilitates smooth rolling motion while maintaining a sleek robotic profile.  

3. **Speed Differential Control for Rolling Movement:**  
   - The design employs **independent speed control of the rolling disks** to enable **forward, backward, and directional movement** without additional steering components.  

4. **Material and Build Innovation:**  
   - **Lightweight aluminum or carbon fiber** frame enhances durability while reducing energy consumption.  
   - **Integrated gear and servo mechanisms** ensure seamless actuation within the rolling disk while maintaining a compact and efficient form.  

## **Statement of Novelty**  
The **Rollopod's** design is a **first-of-its-kind robotic structure** integrating **hexapod walking with a rolling transformation system**, while maintaining an **aesthetically distinct and functionally efficient form**. The **spherical rolling mode, servo-actuated transformation mechanism, and speed differential movement control** contribute to its **unique and non-obvious design elements**.  

## **Claimed Design Aspects**  
1. **Overall Shape and Transformation Design** – The **unique ability to shift from a hexapod to a rolling sphere** while maintaining **functional stability and aesthetics**.  
2. **Leg Mechanism Integration** – A **foldable six-legged system** that fully retracts into a **circular rolling frame**, forming a **streamlined and compact appearance**.  
3. **Rolling Frame with Integrated Actuation** – A **servo-driven disk system** providing **seamless and controlled rolling movement** using **speed differential for directional control**.  
4. **Overall Structural Appearance** – A distinctive **dual-mode robotic form**, aesthetically optimized for both mobility and durability.
